Spring Boot @ConfigurationProperties Example
---------------------------------------------
It is used when we want to externalize(matlab kahi aur jagah us configuration ko rakh kar aur phir us configuration ko code se read karna) our custom properties.

We know that in Spring Boot there is already one file called "application.properties". In that file configuration is given for the application. But what if our application has a lot of configuration data, So we can create our own custom .properties file and store our custom configuration in it, and then read it(Configuration) in our code.

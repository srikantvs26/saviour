What is short circuiting?
-------------------------
ex 1. 

						if(condition1 && condition2){
						
						}

Here if cond1 is false cond2 will not even be checked.


						if(condition1 || condition2){
						
						}

Here if condition1 is true then condition2 will not even be checked.

An intermediate operation is short-circuiting if, when presented with infinite input, 
it may produce a finite stream as a result. 

A terminal operation is short-circuiting if, when presented with infinite input,
it may terminate in finite time.

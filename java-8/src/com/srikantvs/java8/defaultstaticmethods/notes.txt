Interfaces in Java before Java 8
-----------------------------------

Interfaces just define the contract. In Interfaces implementing a method is not allowed.
Only classes which implement that interface can give implementation to that method.


Cons.

Because of this Interfaces cannot be easy evolved. Even if one method is added we have to
have to give implementation of it in implementing class. 


So Default Methods and static methods in interface are introduced.


Default Methods
----------------
1. default keyword is used to identify a default method in an interface.
2. can be overridden in the implementation class
3. default methods helps us in evolving interfaces without impacting the implementation classes.


Static Methods
---------------
1. Similar to default methods.
2. This cannot be overridden by the implementation classes.
